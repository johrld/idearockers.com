# Idearockers Git Workflow (Light)

## Branches
- **develop**: default working branch
- **main**: production; only merge from develop for releases
- **feature/<slug>**: short‑lived branches; open PR → develop

## Conventional commits (minimal)
- `feat:` new feature or content
- `fix:` bug/copy/style fix
- `chore:` deps, tooling, config
- `docs:` docs/rules
- `refactor:` internal changes without behavior change

## Commit assistant
1) Analyze diff → classify change
2) Propose one‑line conventional commit + optional bullets
3) Ask for confirmation → commit

## Release workflow (develop → main)
1) Collect commits since last main
2) Group: features, fixes, UI/content
3) Create release message
4) Merge develop → main with message
5) Tag semantic version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), push tag
6) Switch back to develop

### Versioning
- Use semantic versioning, e.g. `v1.3.0`
- Annotated tags: `git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "feat: homepage refresh + SEO"

## Notes
- Small site: no heavy CI requirements
- Keep PRs small; prefer linear history (squash on merge)
- When adding analytics or major features, update privacy and sitemap accordingly
